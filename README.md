# DishDate
Tinder-style Restaurant Discovery App

DishDate was an entrepreneurial idea I came up with to solve a common problem: finding new, exciting dining experiences without the hassle of endless scrolling through reviews and ratings. I wanted to build a platform where users could discover local restaurants through a fun, gamified experience—swiping right if they were interested and left if they weren’t. The idea was to simplify restaurant discovery by matching users to places they would genuinely enjoy based on their preferences, mood, and location. I envisioned DishDate as the go-to app for spontaneous dining, eliminating decision fatigue and making date nights or friend outings more exciting and effortless. I wanted to combine my love for tech and dining into a product that genuinely improved how people find places to eat. 

After talking to a few people, I identified several problems with my approach, such as using vite. I stopped working on it when I needed to build the backend, since I could have used NextJS and had both front end and back end in one spot. For now, I am putting this idea on hold. However, it is still available to check out on https://dishdate.netlify.app
