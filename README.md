# DishDate
Tinder-style Restaurant Discovery App

DishDate was an entrepreneurial idea I came up with to solve a common problem: finding new, exciting dining experiences. I wanted to build a platform where users could discover local restaurants through a fun, gamified experience—swiping right if they were interested and left if they weren’t. 

I wanted to combine my love for tech and dining into a product that genuinely improved how people find places to eat. 

After talking to a few people, I identified several problems with my approach, such as using vite. I stopped working on it when I needed to build the backend, since I could have used NextJS and had both front end and back end in one spot. For now, I am putting this idea on hold. However, it is still available to check out on https://dishdate.netlify.app
